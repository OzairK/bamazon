# Bamazon App
This is a CLI that allows you to make purchases from a virtual retailer. the app prompts the user to purchase one of the available items.
if there is proper inventory, the sale will go through and tell user what the sale total is. If there is not enough inventory the 
app will let the user know, and user must request a smaller amount to purchase.

The MySQL database will update after every succesfull purchase, with the updated inventory of the purchased product.
